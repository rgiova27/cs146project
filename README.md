# How to Properly Make Changes on GitHub
To edit updated version:
1) Download as zip file
2) Unzip
3) Edit your file

To upload changes on GitHub
1) Select the proper branch  (this allows everyone to work at once with the latest working version)
2) Copy and paste your code onto it and save

Eventually
1) Create pull request for your file/branch
2) Merge to main branch (now changes on main branch reflect your changes)
   You may need to manually resolve conflicting code in this step
   This allows the next person to download everybody's changes instead of one person's upload which may be outdated in other files
